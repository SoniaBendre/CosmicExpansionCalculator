Cosmic Expansion Calculator created to digitalize ASTRO 4 (Development of Astro Thought) Final Project

The objective of this project is to estimate the age of the universe by collecting data to plot Hubble's Law using the "standard size" method. By measuring the distances to several clusters of galaxies based on the apparent diameters of their largest spiral galaxies, a Hubble diagram can be created. The slope of the line on the Hubble diagram then corresponds to the Hubble Constant, which can be used to calculate the time elapsed since the expansion of the universe began.
