# Cosmic Expansion Calculator
Cosmic Expansion Calculator is a project developed for the ASTRO 4 (Development of Astro Thought) Final Project. Its main objective is to estimate the age of the universe by utilizing the "standard size" method to collect data and plot Hubble's Law. By measuring the distances to various clusters of galaxies based on the apparent diameters of their largest spiral galaxies, a Hubble diagram is created. The slope of the line on the Hubble diagram represents the Hubble Constant, which can then be used to calculate the time elapsed since the expansion of the universe began.

## Functionality
The core functionality of the project is implemented in the file CosmicExpansionCalculator.py. This file contains the main functions required for calculating and analyzing the data related to the age of the universe.

To execute the calculations and perform the project's analysis, the file driver.py is utilized.

## Usage
To use the Cosmic Expansion Calculator, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.11.3 or higher).
Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command python driver.py to execute the calculations and generate the results.
Dependencies
The Cosmic Expansion Calculator relies on the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.11.3)
NumPy (version 1.24.3)
Matplotlib (version 3.7.1)
Make sure these dependencies are installed before running the project.
